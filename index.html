<h1>API Plan</h1>
<p>This is a prototype for my subway map API training project, providing a framework for introducing different concepts along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>My original subway map API for this project was a hypermedia API (Siren), and this next version is a static (Jekyll) implemention of the same model, but using Jekyll hosted on Github as the client.</p>
<p>This is all a work in progress, and there is no visual aspects of this implementation yet, but you can find the functionality for one of <a href="http://jekyll.hypermedia.client.apievangelist.com/design/area/">the API areas (design) here/a>, with <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/jekyll-hypermedia-client/tree/master/_design">the Siren collection on Github</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/jekyll-hypermedia-client/tree/master/_layouts">the templates that act as the client</a>.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/jekyll-hypermedia-client/issues">questions you can leave thoughts on Github issues for the project</a>.</p>
